        In this book, you’ll step into my dark, encrypted past where I found myself trampled under the weight of my own sin and the opinions of others. In a last-ditch effort to save my life I found my STRENGTH to surrender to God’s Will in the darkness to finally believe in the unimaginable.

        Your D.U.T.Y. journey is an intentional pause on life to face whatever is keeping you from feeling, knowing, and simultaneously believing you deserve good things because of your stained past. This book is your answered prayer from God that his Grace extends abundantly to people like or worse than you!

        There is no one-size-fits-all approach to healing trauma, and this book offers minimum direction for your personal issues. However, if you’re ready to discover a version of you that you haven’t met before or seen in a long time, I challenge you to Do Your D.U.T.Y., and let’s build the real-life families, friendships, and communities we all desire.
